# HttpVanilli

`HttpVanilli` is a flexible web connection mocking library. It gives you lip-synced http connections with pluggable band members for testing.

## Install

    gem install http_vanilli

## Usage

[Please see api.eg.html][api]

[api]: http://lachie.github.com/http_vanilli 

## Rationale

`TODO`, but see [the api example][api] for how it differs from Fakeweb & webmock.

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I donâ€™t break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
